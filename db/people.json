She got her bachelor's degree in Biological Science from Ocean University of China and joint the lab in 2013 for her PhD study with Patrick. She entered the field of synthetic biology by participating in the iGEM competition. She was the leader of 2011 OUC iGEM team and supervised the 2012 OUC iGEM team. Her PhD research projects include developing tyrosine recombinase in vivo for orthogonal SCRaMbLE of synthetic chromosomes for the Sc2.0 consortium and in vitro recombinase toolkit for metabolic engineering. She’s also working on the synthetic natural product (SynNP) project to discover new antibiotics using the synthetic biology platform. She likes travelling, seafood, Ceilidh, concert and music shows. She loves pipette but is also learning to play violin and ukulele to enjoy life. ",
